Program is Windows only for now. This is due to the saving and loading widgets being Windows only (using pywin32). You're free to modify the code to add file loading and saving for other platforms. Features Infinite grid Add and remove a fog of war effect Import maps from image files Place, move and remove pieces on a grid (can be matched to image grid) Place 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 pieces Make markings on the map to show areas of effect or point out things to the players Save and load file to a single JSON file (no need to keep the image file separately!) How to use When installing from pypi , the library should come with a script named dndfog that you can run. It should be available in your environment if the Python\\Scripts folder is set in PATH. You can also download an EXE from the GitHub releases . When the program opens, you need to select an image file to use as a background, or a JSON data file to load a map from. You can also lauch the program with a positional argument <filepath> to add an initial file. The program does not autosave! You have to save (and override) the file yourself! Keyboard shortcuts Toolbar: - Open/close the toolbar: TAB - Select tool from the toolbar: Quick select with the number keys 1-9 or click the tool button with Left mouse button when the toolbar is open Camera: - Move camera: Click and drag: Middle mouse button - Zoom in: Any tool except the grid tool selected from the toolbar + Scroll wheel: Up - Zoom out: Any tool except the grid tool selected from the toolbar + Scroll wheel: Down Piece (quick select: 1 ): - Add a piece: Select the piece tool from the toolbar + Right mouse button on an empty square - Remove a piece: Select the piece tool from the toolbar + Right mouse button on a piece - Move a piece: Select the piece tool from the toolbar + Click and drag: Left mouse button Fog (quick select: 2 ): - Add fog: Select the fog tool from the toolbar + Left mouse button - Remove fog: Select the fog tool from the toolbar + Right mouse button - Show/hide fog: F1 or the checkbox in the fog toolbar - Change fog size: Select the size to use from the size selector in the fog toolbar Map (quick select: 3 ): - Move map image: Select the map tool from the toolbar + Click and drag: Left mouse button Grid (quick select: 4 ): - Increase gridsize: Select the grid tool from the toolbar + Scroll wheel: Up - Decrease gridsize: Select the grid tool from the toolbar + Scroll wheel: Down - Show/hide grid: F2 or the checkbox in the fog toolbar Mark (quick select: 5 ): - Make markings: Select the mark tool from the toolbar + Click and drag: Left mouse button - Erase markings: Select the mark tool from the toolbar + Click and drag: Right mouse button - Clear markings: Click the clear button in the mark toolbar - Change marker color: Use the color selector in the mark toolbar Misc: - Save file: CTRL + S (will skip file dialog if json data file already exists) - Save file as: CTRL + Shift + S (will always open a file dialog) - Open file: CTRL + O - Quit program: Press the X mutton on the window Known issues or lacking features Matching program gridsize to background gridsize is a bit awkward When zooming, the program grid and background map might not stay aligned It's hard to keep track of combat, since there is no built-in turn order tracking It's too easy to accidentally remove fog you didn't mean to.
